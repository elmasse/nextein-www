Nextein follows `Next` directory structure. As an overview, these are the relevant files and folders on a `Nextein` project:

```bash
├── pages
│   ├── index.js
│   └── post.js
├── posts
│   └── hello.md
├── static
│   └── hello.png
├── .babelrc
├── next.config.js
└── package.json

```

## /pages

The `/pages` folder contains all Page Components. These components will be used as either the page that list a set of posts or render a single post. 

> Example
>
> `index.js`, `post.js`, `about.js`, `contact.js`

## /posts

Stores all posts in markdown format. There is no need for an specific name convention. You can use whatever you want. In case you decide to use a date prefix it will be used and removed from the name property.

> Example
>
> `hello-world.md`, `2017-08-10-post-with-date.md`, `01-first-post.md`

## /static

The static folder serves as a repository for any static content such as images, css, videos, etc.

> Example
>
> `image.png`, `custom.css`

## .babelrc

This file is used by Next to define customized configuration for `babel`. This is optional.

## next.config.js

The config file for `Next`. It is mandatory and it should be defined with the `Nextein` config wrapper.

> Example
>
>```js
>const { withNextein } = require('nextein/config')
>
>module.exports = withNextein({
>  // place your next config in here!
>})
>```

## package.json

This file is generated by `npm`. It will define the scripts to run `next` binaries for development, build and export among others.

> Example
>
>```json
>{
>  "scripts": {
>    "dev": "next",
>    "export": "next build && next export"
>  }
>}
>
>```
