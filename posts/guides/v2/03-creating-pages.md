In the previous guides we have seen how to create your `index` page listing all your posts, how to filter them, and how to render a single post. Now we are going to explore how to create a different section page. 

We will generate a new page (or section) for posts in a certain category. By default, if you nest your posts in subfolders, the generated category matches the directory structure. This means that if you have posts in `posts/blog` then the `blog` category is assigned automatically.

If we want to create our blog as a separated section, we can generate our `/blog` by creating a new page component `pages/blog.js`. This component will render only those posts within the `blog` category:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { withPostsFilterBy, inCategory } from 'nextein/posts'
import { Content } from 'nextein/post' 

const fromBlog = withPostsFilterBy(inCategory('blog', { includeSubCategories: true }))

export default fromBlog(({ posts }) => (
    <main>
    {
      posts.map((post, idx) => <Content key={`post-${idx}`} {...post} excerpt />)
    }
    </main>
  )
)

```

Now, this is not different from the example in the previous guide. But in this case we want to generate a `/blog`. To do that, we just need to adjust our `exportPathMap` in `next.config.js` as follows (only needed in versions prior to `v2.5.0`):

```js

const nexteinConfig = require('nextein/config').default

module.exports = nexteinConfig({
  exportPathMap: () => ({
    '/blog': { page: '/blog' }
  })
})

```

From `v2.5.0` this is **not needed** anymore. Also you if you define a `exportPathMap` function you will get a `defaultPathMap` object as a parameter (same behavior as in `next`). And you have to return **all** paths that will be exported:

```js
module.exports = nexteinConfig({
  exportPathMap: (defaultPathMap) => ({
    ...defaultPathMap,
    '/blog': { page: '/blog' } // Not needed, but for reference.
  })
})
```

That's all you need. You should be able to navigate to `localhost:3000/blog` if you run `npm run dev`.
